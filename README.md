### Hi there 👋 my name is *Ervan Achirou*. 
I am a PhD Student at the Paris Saclay Neuroscience Institue 🧑‍🔬 currently working on the processes of somato-sensory integration

I have a huge interest in cortico-cortical communication in the brain 🧠 and Brain-computer-interfaces. 

I am using python and arduino as part of my work.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Arduino, Python 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to BCI or Data processing
